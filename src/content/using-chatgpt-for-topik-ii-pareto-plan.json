To keep things focused, I’m using ChatGPT as a Pareto planner — squeezing the highest score impact out of the smallest set of vocabulary and skills.\n\n---\n\n## The Exact Prompt I Used\n\n`text\nYou are a TOPIK preparation expert and Korean linguistics coach.\nI am currently TOPIK Level 4 aiming to reach Level 5 in 10 weeks.\n\nApply the Pareto principle to identify the 20% of vocabulary topics and word categories that will deliver 80% of the benefit for the TOPIK II exam.\n\nRequirements:\n\t1.\tProvide a ranked list of high-yield vocabulary topics based on past TOPIK frequency analysis, with reasoning for each category.\n\t2.\tGive theoretical guidance on why these categories produce the greatest score impact.\n\t3.\tInclude examples of words from each topic (Hangul + English meaning + sample sentence).\n\t4.\tExplain optimal vocabulary learning strategies for short-term mastery (10 weeks), focusing on efficiency and retention.\n\t5.\tKeep explanations entirely in English, except for the Korean vocabulary.\n\nFinal output format:\nA. Priority Vocabulary Topics (ranked + reasoning)\nB. Example Vocabulary for Each Topic (Hangul | English meaning | Example sentence)\nC. Theory of Impact (how these vocab sets influence reading, listening, and writing scores)\nD. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies (Pareto-based theory, memory methods, and review systems)\n`\n\n---\n\n## What ChatGPT Gave Me (Summary)\n\nGoal framing: engineer a 10-week plan that targets the repeatable vocabulary core of TOPIK II to maximize gains in reading, listening, and writing.\n\n### A. Priority Vocabulary Topics (Ranked)\n1. Academic and formal connectors and transition words — essential for coherence and essay scoring; common in editorials and formal texts.\n2. Government, society, and policy terms — frequent in news and report passages.\n3. Business, economy, and workplace vocabulary — appears in long readings and monologues.\n4. Education and research — statistics, surveys, abstracts.\n5. Environment and technology — contemporary issues and cause–effect logic.\n6. Formal synonyms and register variants — higher-register equivalents that boost sophistication.\n7. Idioms and 사자성어 — elevate style and appear in advanced readings.\n8. Opinion and argument structure vocabulary — enables clear, logical essays.\n\n### B. Example Vocabulary (Samples)\n- Connectors: 그러므로, 게다가, 따라서\n- Policy and society: 정책, 복지, 규제\n- Business and economy: 거래, 고용, 투자\n- Education and research: 통계, 논문, 실험\n- Environment and technology: 오염, 재생 에너지, 첨단 기술\n- Formal variants: 확인하다 → 검증하다, 말하다 → 발언하다, 필요하다 → 요구되다\n- Idioms: 일석이조, 막상막하, 동문서답\n- Argumentation: 한편, 반면에, 결론적으로\n\n### C. Why These Matter (Theory of Impact)\n- Reading: these sets dominate high-value passages; recognizing them reduces guesswork and time.\n- Listening: news-style audio hinges on connectors and domain terms; missing one key word can flip meaning.\n- Writing: Level 5 rubrics reward formal register, logical flow, and precise domain vocabulary.\n- Pareto payoff: roughly 20% of vocabulary covers about 80% of high-impact exam contexts.\n\n### D. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies\n- Chunk and collocate: learn by topic plus function; memorize natural pairings like 규제를 강화하다 and 복지를 확대하다.\n- Active recall with spaced repetition: SRS decks in both directions (K→E and E→K), with daily reviews weighted to older cards.\n- Input–output loop: one short news article daily, then write two to three sentences using target words.\n- Shadowing and retelling: use KBS or EBS news to internalize register and phrasing, then retell in your own words.\n- Writing simulation: twice weekly, practice essays enforcing connectors plus topic terms.\n- Weekly Core 50: learn about 50 high-yield words per week with a Mon–Sun cycle (learn → use → test → review).\n\n---\n\n## My Plan Going Forward\n\n- Weekly focus: 50 high-yield words from the ranked topics, tracked in a single deck.\n- Daily routine:\n  - 20–30 minutes SRS review with emphasis on older cards.\n  - Read one news piece; highlight and add 5–10 words.\n  - Write three to five original sentences using today’s targets.\n- Speaking and listening: 10 minutes shadowing, followed by a two-minute retell.\n- Writing: two timed essays per week using at least five connectors plus five topic terms.\n- Sunday audit: quick oral review and deck clean-up.\n\nEnd summarising: I plan to follow the Anki plan it suggested."
