I will use ChatGPT as my study coach and focus on high-yield vocabulary. Although my goal is Level 5, my prompt aims for Level 6 to optimise my learning further.\n\n### Prompt I Used\n\n```\n`You are a TOPIK preparation expert and Korean linguistics coach.\nI am currently TOPIK Level 4 aiming to reach Level 6 in 10 weeks.\n\nApply the Pareto principle to identify the 20% of vocabulary topics and word categories that will deliver 80% of the benefit for the TOPIK II exam.\n\nRequirements:\n\t1.\tProvide a ranked list of high-yield vocabulary topics based on past TOPIK frequency analysis, with reasoning for each category.\n\t2.\tGive theoretical guidance on why these categories produce the greatest score impact.\n\t3.\tInclude examples of words from each topic (Hangul + English meaning + sample sentence).\n\t4.\tExplain optimal vocabulary learning strategies for short-term mastery (10 weeks), focusing on efficiency and retention.\n\t5.\tKeep explanations entirely in English, except for the Korean vocabulary.\n\nFinal output format:\nA. Priority Vocabulary Topics (ranked + reasoning)\nB. Example Vocabulary for Each Topic (Hangul | English meaning | Example sentence)\nC. Theory of Impact (how these vocab sets influence reading, listening, and writing scores)\nD. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies (Pareto-based theory, memory methods, and review systems)\n`\n```\n\nThis is what ChatGPT returned.\n\n## A. Priority Vocabulary Topics (Ranked + Reasoning)\n\n**1. Academic & Formal Connectors / Transition Words**\n\n* **Reasoning:** These glue sentences together in reading passages and are indispensable for high-scoring writing. Without them, you lose coherence points. High frequency in argumentative essays & formal news excerpts.\n\n**2. Government, Society, & Policy Terms**\n\n* **Reasoning:** TOPIK II often features news reports, editorials, and informational texts on policies, rights, social systems. Covers a huge chunk of mid/high-level reading passages.\n\n**3. Business, Economy, & Work-related Vocabulary**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Economic and workplace topics appear in long readings and listening monologues. Also useful for formal opinion writing.\n\n**4. Education & Research**\n\n* **Reasoning:** High recurrence in reports, statistics, surveys. Appears in both reading comprehension and data-description writing tasks.\n\n**5. Environment & Technology**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Common in contemporary issue essays and reading topics; also tests ability to understand abstract concepts and cause-effect relationships.\n\n**6. Formal Synonyms & Register Variants**\n\n* **Reasoning:** TOPIK loves to test recognition of advanced formal equivalents of common verbs/adjectives (e.g., 말하다 → 발언하다). Mastery boosts both reading accuracy and writing sophistication.\n\n**7. Idiomatic Expressions & Four-character Sino-Korean Words (사자성어)**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Appear in advanced readings and boost writing style score dramatically. High yield in Level 5 grading.\n\n**8. Opinion & Argument Structure Vocabulary**\n\n* **Reasoning:** Critical for essay sections; lets you argue persuasively and logically.\n\n## B. Example Vocabulary for Each Topic\n\n**1. Academic & Formal Connectors**\n\n* **그러므로** | therefore | 그러므로 우리는 대책을 세워야 한다.\n* **게다가** | moreover | 게다가 비용도 저렴하다.\n* **따라서** | consequently | 따라서 환경 보호가 필요하다.\n\n**2. Government, Society, & Policy**\n\n* **정책** | policy | 정부는 새로운 교육 정책을 발표했다.\n* **복지** | welfare | 복지 제도가 확대되고 있다.\n* **규제** | regulation | 환경 규제가 강화되었다.\n\n**3. Business, Economy, & Work**\n\n* **거래** | transaction | 온라인 거래가 늘어나고 있다.\n* **고용** | employment | 청년 고용률이 상승했다.\n* **투자** | investment | 해외 투자 규모가 확대됐다.\n\n**4. Education & Research**\n\n* **통계** | statistics | 통계에 따르면 대학 진학률이 높다.\n* **논문** | thesis | 그는 대학원에서 논문을 작성 중이다.\n* **실험** | experiment | 이 실험은 많은 시간을 필요로 한다.\n\n**5. Environment & Technology**\n\n* **오염** | pollution | 대기 오염이 심각한 수준이다.\n* **재생 에너지** | renewable energy | 재생 에너지 사용이 늘고 있다.\n* **첨단 기술** | advanced technology | 첨단 기술이 산업을 변화시키고 있다.\n\n**6. Formal Synonyms & Register Variants**\n\n* **확인하다 → 검증하다** | verify | 실험 결과를 검증해야 한다.\n* **말하다 → 발언하다** | remark | 회의에서 중요한 발언을 했다.\n* **필요하다 → 요구되다** | be required | 전문 지식이 요구된다.\n\n**7. Idiomatic / 사자성어**\n\n* **일석이조** | kill two birds with one stone | 여행도 하고 공부도 하니 일석이조다.\n* **막상막하** | neck and neck | 두 팀의 실력은 막상막하다.\n* **동문서답** | irrelevant answer | 그는 질문에 동문서답을 했다.\n\n**8. Opinion / Argument Structure**\n\n* **한편** | on the other hand | 한편, 다른 의견도 있다.\n* **반면에** | whereas | 도시는 편리한 반면에 시끄럽다.\n* **결론적으로** | in conclusion | 결론적으로, 우리는 변화를 선택해야 한다.\n\n## C. Theory of Impact\n\n* **Reading:** These vocabulary sets appear in high-frequency, high-scoring sections: editorials, research abstracts, statistical descriptions. Recognizing them drastically reduces time spent guessing meaning.\n* **Listening:** News-style listening uses formal connectors, policy/economic terms, and tech/environment vocabulary. Missing one key word can distort the entire passage’s meaning.\n* **Writing:** The scoring rubric for Level 5 heavily rewards formal register, logical flow, and topic-specific vocabulary. Using precise connectors, domain-specific nouns, and formal synonyms can push essays into the top band.\n* **Pareto Payoff:** These categories cover ~20% of total vocabulary but recur in ~80% of high-value exam contexts.\n\n## D. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies\n\n**1. Chunk & Collocate**\n\n* Learn words in *topic + function* clusters (e.g., environment + cause-effect connectors) instead of isolated lists.\n* Use collocations (규제를 강화하다, 복지를 확대하다) for faster recall in writing.\n\n**2. Use Active Recall with Spaced Repetition**\n\n* Anki or Quizlet decks with **Korean → English** and **English → Korean** prompts.\n* Daily review: old cards (80%) + new cards (20%).\n\n**3. Input-Output Loop**\n\n* **Input:** Read 1 short news article daily (연합뉴스, 한겨레) and highlight target words.\n* **Output:** Write 2–3 sentences using each new word, ideally linking to TOPIK-style topics.\n\n**4. Shadowing & Retelling**\n\n* Shadow audio from KBS News / EBS 뉴스 to capture natural phrasing and register.\n* Retell the content in your own words using new vocabulary.\n\n**5. Writing Simulation**\n\n* Twice a week: pick a past TOPIK II essay prompt, force yourself to use at least **5 formal connectors** + **5 topic-specific terms**.\n\n**6. Weekly Core 50 Review**\n\n* Choose **50 high-yield words** from the priority list weekly.\n* Monday: Learn\n* Tue–Thu: Use in speaking/writing\n* Fri: Review test\n* Sat: Use in timed writing\n* Sun: Quick oral review\n\n## Closing\n\nI will follow this plan for the next 10 weeks and track my progress."
