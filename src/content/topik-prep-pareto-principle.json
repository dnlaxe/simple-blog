I asked ChatGPT to act as a TOPIK preparation expert and Korean linguistics coach, applying the **Pareto principle** to identify the 20% of vocabulary topics that would deliver 80% of the score benefit.\n\nThe results were structured and targeted, giving me a clear roadmap for vocabulary acquisition.\n\n---\n\n### A. Priority Vocabulary Topics (Ranked + Reasoning)\n\n1. **Academic & Formal Vocabulary**  \n   Frequent in reading passages, official documents, and news-style listening materials. Covers abstract concepts that appear in essays and opinion questions.\n2. **Social & Cultural Issues**  \n   Recurring topics in writing prompts and debates—education, environment, technology, and culture.\n3. **Government & Public Policy Terms**  \n   High appearance rate in TOPIK reading sections involving laws, systems, and public services.\n4. **Connective and Transition Words**  \n   Critical for cohesive writing and listening comprehension, often used in both questions and answers.\n5. **Everyday Functional Expressions**  \n   Useful for listening and short-answer writing; covers common verbs, requests, and situational phrases.\n\n---\n\n### B. Example Vocabulary for Each Topic\n\n**1. Academic & Formal Vocabulary**  \n- 연구 | research | 그는 환경 연구를 진행하고 있다. (He is conducting environmental research.)\n- 현상 | phenomenon | 기후 변화 현상이 심각해지고 있다. (The climate change phenomenon is worsening.)\n\n**2. Social & Cultural Issues**  \n- 환경보호 | environmental protection | 환경보호는 모두의 책임이다. (Environmental protection is everyone's responsibility.)\n- 저출산 | low birth rate | 저출산 문제를 해결해야 한다. (We must solve the low birth rate problem.)\n\n**3. Government & Public Policy Terms**  \n- 복지 | welfare | 정부는 복지 제도를 확대하고 있다. (The government is expanding the welfare system.)\n- 정책 | policy | 새로운 교육 정책이 발표되었다. (A new education policy was announced.)\n\n**4. Connective and Transition Words**  \n- 그러나 | however | 그는 노력했으나, 그러나 실패했다. (He tried, however, he failed.)\n- 따라서 | therefore | 문제가 심각하므로, 따라서 대책이 필요하다. (The problem is serious, therefore measures are needed.)\n\n**5. Everyday Functional Expressions**  \n- 부탁하다 | to ask a favor | 친구에게 숙제를 부탁했다. (I asked my friend for help with homework.)\n- 확인하다 | to confirm | 예약을 다시 확인해 주세요. (Please confirm the reservation again.)\n\n---\n\n### C. Theory of Impact\n\nThese vocab sets directly influence TOPIK II performance because:\n- **Reading**: Academic, cultural, and policy-related terms frequently appear in dense texts. Recognizing them reduces processing time.\n- **Listening**: High-frequency connectors and functional expressions help parse sentence structure and intent.\n- **Writing**: Formal terms and connectors elevate essay style, meeting scoring criteria for vocabulary range and appropriateness.\n\nBy focusing on these, I’m covering the linguistic backbone of most high-level exam questions.\n\n---\n\n### D. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies\n\n- **Pareto-Based Targeting**: Concentrate first on the top-ranked topics until mastery, then expand.\n- **Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS)**: Use Anki or similar apps for 10–15 minute daily reviews.\n- **Active Recall**: Test myself on Hangul → meaning and meaning → Hangul.\n- **Contextual Learning**: Use example sentences in writing practice and mock speaking responses.\n- **Weekly Mock Review**: Apply learned vocab in timed writing and listening exercises to reinforce retention under exam conditions.\n\n---\n\nBy combining ChatGPT’s structured guidance with focused study habits, I’m maximizing my limited preparation time for TOPIK II Level 6."
