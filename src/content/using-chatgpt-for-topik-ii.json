My goal is to study the highest-impact vocabulary first and use ChatGPT to keep the plan simple and focused. Although my target is Level 5, I have included Level 6 in my prompt to optimise my learning.\n\n## Exact Prompt I Used\n```\nYou are a TOPIK preparation expert and Korean linguistics coach.\nI am currently TOPIK Level 4 aiming to reach Level 6 in 10 weeks.\n\nApply the Pareto principle to identify the 20% of vocabulary topics and word categories that will deliver 80% of the benefit for the TOPIK II exam.\n\nRequirements:\n\t1.\tProvide a ranked list of high-yield vocabulary topics based on past TOPIK frequency analysis, with reasoning for each category.\n\t2.\tGive theoretical guidance on why these categories produce the greatest score impact.\n\t3.\tInclude examples of words from each topic (Hangul + English meaning + sample sentence).\n\t4.\tExplain optimal vocabulary learning strategies for short-term mastery (10 weeks), focusing on efficiency and retention.\n\t5.\tKeep explanations entirely in English, except for the Korean vocabulary.\n\nFinal output format:\nA. Priority Vocabulary Topics (ranked + reasoning)\nB. Example Vocabulary for Each Topic (Hangul | English meaning | Example sentence)\nC. Theory of Impact (how these vocab sets influence reading, listening, and writing scores)\nD. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies (Pareto-based theory, memory methods, and review systems)\n```\n\n## What ChatGPT Returned\nChatGPT produced a structured plan that ranks high-yield vocabulary areas, gives examples for each topic, explains why these sets matter for the exam, and outlines short, efficient study methods.\n\n## Summary of ChatGPT’s Answer\n\n### A. Priority Vocabulary Topics (ranked + reasoning)\n1. Academic and formal connectors/transition words — improve coherence and writing scores; common in news/editorials.\n2. Government, society, and policy terms — frequent in informational texts and editorials.\n3. Business, economy, and work vocabulary — appears in long readings and listening monologues.\n4. Education and research — common in reports, statistics, and surveys.\n5. Environment and technology — frequent in contemporary issues and cause–effect passages.\n6. Formal synonyms and register variants — boost reading accuracy and writing sophistication.\n7. Idioms and 사자성어 — support advanced reading and high-band writing style.\n8. Opinion and argument structure vocabulary — essential for essay tasks.\n\n### B. What the Examples Look Like\nFor each topic, ChatGPT listed Korean words with English meanings and a short sample sentence. Examples covered connectors (예: 그러므로), policy/economy terms (정책, 규제), academic items (통계, 논문), environment/tech (오염, 재생 에너지), formal variants (발언하다, 검증하다), idioms (일석이조), and argument signals (한편, 결론적으로).\n\n### C. Why These Sets Matter (Theory of Impact)\n- Reading: these words appear often in high-value passages and speed up comprehension.\n- Listening: news-style audio relies on connectors and domain terms; missing one can change the meaning.\n- Writing: precise connectors, domain nouns, and formal register raise the score.\n- Pareto idea: this small set covers a large share of exam contexts.\n\n### D. High-Efficiency Learning Strategies\n- Learn in topic-plus-function chunks and use collocations.\n- Use active recall with spaced repetition (daily review mix).\n- Input–output loop: read a short news piece daily and write with target words.\n- Shadow and retell from reliable news audio.\n- Simulate writing: use multiple formal connectors and topic terms each essay.\n- Weekly “Core 50” cycle: learn, use, review, and test.\n\n## Closing\nI will follow this plan for the next 10 weeks and track my progress toward TOPIK Level 5."
